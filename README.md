This is a very basic JavaScript tutorial/example geared towards beginners written by Jacqueline S. Homan and Leah LaSalla. 
Examples in JavaScript include the creating of JavaScript manifests, creating and manipulating HTML elements such as the creating of
text input and button elements, timers, form-hiding, and accordian effects. 
The code is well-documented and commented throughout, giving the beginning coding student a good basis for understanding JavaScript and 
building on that understanding for using jQuery libraries.
